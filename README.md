# Revature College
This is a Java console-based application; using Java8, Maven, PostgreSQL, and AWS RDS.

The idea is to create a college portal in which there are 2 types of users: Student and Professor.
- A student can:
  + creating new account
  + login/logout
  + checking student information
  + applying scholarship
- A professor can
  + creating new account
  + login/logout
  + checking students list
  + Checking current scholarship applications list
  + approving/denying scholarship application
